# Passh: a Pass fork

Pass is a simple password store. This fork changes a few things while trying to maintain most of it intact, specially the core idea. I will keep pulling pass commits, and also pushing my modifications to them.

This repository is for the **website only**: [passh.hackan.net](https://passh.hackan.net). Maybe you are looking for the [master branch](https://github.com/hackancuba/passh), where passh's source is.

## About

This is a very simple password store that encrypts passwords using gpg and
places the encrypted password in a directory. It can generate new passwords
and keep track of old ones.

Please see the [man page](https://github.com/hackancuba/passh/blob/master/man/passh.md) for documentation and examples: `man passh`.
