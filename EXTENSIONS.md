# Extensions

A curated list of some extensions I wrote and/or recommend.

Extensions listed for Passh won't work with Pass. Others work with both.

## Passh only

* [insert](https://github.com/HacKanCuBa/passh-extension-insert): provides a convenient solution to insert a file or password into the store, overriding native insert command.
* [init](https://github.com/HacKanCuBa/passh-extension-init): provides a convenient solution to init the store along with its git repo, overriding native init command.

## Both (Passh and Pass)

* [insertfile](https://github.com/HacKanCuBa/pass-extension-insertfile): provides a convenient solution to insert a file into the store.
* [initgit](https://github.com/HacKanCuBa/pass-extension-initgit): provides a convenient solution to init the store along with its git repo.
* [otp](https://github.com/tadfisher/pass-otp): managing one-time-password (OTP) tokens.
